# HoleSols: Manhole Monitoring and Detection System

## Overview
**HoleSols** is an innovative IoT-based solution designed to enhance public safety by addressing the dangers posed by open or damaged manholes. This system employs IoT sensors to monitor manhole conditions in real-time, detecting issues such as missing covers, blockages, or overflow risks. Alerts are sent to relevant authorities and nearby pedestrians via an integrated alarm and mobile app system, ensuring timely intervention. The project won AICTE's The Inventors Challenge 2023 and several other hackathons. It combines technology and public safety to prevent accidents and improve urban infrastructure management.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of manhole status using IoT sensors.
- **Alert Management**: Sends notifications to authorities and alerts nearby pedestrians/drivers.
- **Temporary Manhole Coverage**: Deploys temporary covers to enhance safety.
- **Geolocation-Based Alerts**: Provides real-time location-based alerts and warnings.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Detects water levels to prevent overflow and related accidents.
